// Resident load is useful when you want to load data from an already loaded table. It can be data that is loaded with a SELECT statement 
// where you do not have the option to use script functions. Then you get a temporary table that can be used for calculations or filtering.
// Once you have achieved the purpose of the temporary table, it should be dropped using the DROP TABLE statement.
