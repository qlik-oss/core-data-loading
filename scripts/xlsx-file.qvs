// This script shows a simple example of how to load data from an Ecxel file.
// The options on the last line specify how data in the Ecxel file shall be
// interpreted, for example, that the first line contains header names
// ('embedded labels'), that the file is in the Open Document Format
// ('ooxml'), and that data shall be read from the sheet named 'Airports'
// ('table is Airports').

Airports:
    LOAD
        *
    FROM [lib://data/airports.xlsx]
    (ooxml, embedded labels, table is Airports);
